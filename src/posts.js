    title: `How to live a Happy Life`,
    subTitle: `Even when There's no hope for you`,
    excerpt: `Happiness is one of the most sought-after goals in life, yet for many it seems to be elusive.`,
    content: `<p>"Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."</p>
              <p>Aristotle said this more than 2,000 years ago. And it still holds true today. What is the true purpose of life, if not to live a happy life until we die?
              <br><br>
              Happiness is one of the most sought-after goals in life, yet for many it seems to be elusive. It's easy to delude ourselves into thinking, "When I just have that nice house and new car, then I can be happy." But in reality, happiness is available to all of us, right now. A big house or a new car won't actually make you happier; it's the simple joys in life that bring true happiness. Read on to learn 15 simple ways that you can start living a happier life today.
              <br><br>
              <h2>1. Do What You Love</h2>
              If your passion is playing soccer, writing poems, or teaching children how to swim, make time to do it. You'll find that when you're doing what you love, you're filled with joy. How much better does that sound than forcing yourself do something you don't like?
              <br><br>
              <h2>2. Help Others</h2>
              Sometimes after we've achieved our own personal goals, we still feel empty inside because we haven't made a meaningful contribution to someone else's life. When we volunteer or help others, it feels good to just be of service to someone else. The impact we make feels fulfilling and is a big potential source for our own happiness.
              <br><br>
              <h2>3. Be Thankful</h2>
              When you think of all the things that you have to be grateful for, you realize how blessed you already are. Without even realizing it, we take our basic necessities for granted -- a roof over your head and plenty of food to eat. By appreciating the things that you already have, you'll begin to feel happier in your life.
              <br><br>
              <h2>4. Share With Others</h2>
              When we share our thoughts, our time, and our abilities with others we feel better for it. A life lived without sharing can become lonely. When you share with others, they'll feel great towards you and help you to feel more joy in your own life.
              <br><br>
              <h2>5. Smile More</h2>
              Practice smiling more and see how it affects you internally, as well as those around you. You can always afford to give a smile. Smiling can make you happier -- even if you have to force it, you'll still feel better.
              <br><br>
              <h2>6. Exercise</h2>
              When was the last time you went to the gym or worked out? Exercise reduces stress and releases endorphins, also known as a "runner's high." Playing sports is a fun way to exercise as well, whether it's kicking around a soccer ball or shooting hoops.
              <br><br>
              <h2>7. Seek Out a Life Coach</h2>
              A life coach will help you to evaluate your life and why you're not feeling happy in it. Maybe you're holding limiting beliefs or you have an emotional block without realizing it. By speaking to a life coach, you can uncover why you're actually unhappy and what you can do to feel better.
              <br><br>
              <h2>8. Find Ways to Manage Stress</h2>
              Don't let stress rob you of your birthright to be happy. You deserve to be happy, and it wouldn't be right to let stress get in the way. Practices such as meditation can help you to manage stress better and feel great.
              <br><br>
              <h2>9. Eat Healthy</h2>
              It's much more challenging to feel truly happy when you're sick. But when you eat right, you feel better both physically and mentally. And you'll avoid that guilty feeling that you just pigged out on junk food.
              <br><br>
              <h2>10. Spend Time With Your Loved Ones</h2>
              There's no replacement for spending quality time with your loved ones. We're social beings, even if you're an introvert or a loner. People love spending time with their friends and family for good conversation, bonding, and some laughs. Life's too short to live it completely alone.
              <br><br>
              <h2>11. Dump Negative Thinking</h2>
              You already know that negative thinking will bring you down. So how do you stop it? Become more aware of it and try replacing your negative thoughts with some positive ones. Spend less time with negative people and more time with positive people.
              <br><br>
              <h2>12. Give More Gifts</h2>
              You don't have to give expensive gifts; sometimes a poem, a quick note, or a thoughtful email will brighten someone else's day, and yours. Share what you can give to all the wonderful people in your life.
              <br><br>
              <h2>13. Forgive and Forget</h2>
              Holding a grudge will harm you more than the person you're holding it against. Ask yourself, "What would it take for me to let go of the past?" and notice how you feel when you let go of your anger for a few seconds. Focus instead on a bright future and you'll feel better for it.
              <br><br>
              <h2>14. Take a Walk in Nature</h2>
              Spending time out in nature can be very refreshing and renewing, especially when you're living in an artificial, manmade world. Taking a walk in your local woods or park and getting some fresh air can allow you to appreciate the beauty of the natural world.
              <br><br>
              <h2>15. Be Yourself</h2>
              As Steve Jobs said, "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life." Accept who you are, just be yourself, and you'll feel a world of difference.

    excerpt: `We're supporting Planned Parenthood, Black Girls Code, Yellowhammer Fund and Know Your Rights Camp.`, 
    content: `<p>Last year, we announced we were committing $1 million over the next 10 years, or about $100,00 per year, to various good causes through Bueno, the side of our company that gives back.</p>
              <br />
              <p>We started Bueno years ago because we recognized our good fortune and wanted to help organizations that help others, especially disadvantaged groups. We've supported conference and retreat scholarships for underrepresented groups, we’ve given to Planned Parenthood and we helped an innovation center and startup incubator with a focus on disabled entrepreneurs. We’ve given to the homeless in Portland and raised money for immigrant families at the border.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>This year we are continuing to donate to causes that mean something to us. And to increase the size of the donations, we’ve been using Twitter to spread the word and match donations, connecting with people with similar values along the way. It's all been very encouraging, but there is still more work to do.</p>
              <br />
              <p>With the election coming up quickly, we are gearing up to donate to organizations that specialize in voter turnout, fighting voter suppression and intimidation, phone banking and letter writing, along with donating to candidates in battleground districts and states. More on that soon.</p>
              <br />
              <p>But here are some the causes and organizations we’ve donated to so far this year:</p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>During Black History Month, we were going to raise up to $10,000 in matching donations to Black Girls Code, which helps young women of color build skills in tech. Within three days, we raised $21,000 for the organization, much of it from people we’ve never met.</li>
                <li>For International Women’s Day in March we donated once again to Planned Parenthood, one of the most critical organizations for women’s reproductive health. We took to Twitter to encourage people to donate as well, matching donations up to $5,000.</li>
                <li>In May, we matched donating up to $2,500 to the Yellowhammer Fund, which supports women in Alabama who need access to abortion and reproductive health clinics.</li>
                <li>And in June, we matched $10,000 in donations to the Know Your Rights Camp COVID-19 Relief Fund to help address the needs to Black and Brown communities disproportionately affected by coronavirus.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Do you have a worthy cause you think Bueno should support? Tell us about it on Bueno.co.</p>`,

              <br>
              <p>We will take every action possible to take care of our people and our communities. We will do this together and come out stronger than ever.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This is not a time where everything will remain normal. What seems impossible today can become a reality in a few days. That will continue to be the case for a while. We all need to continuously readjust our expectations as we get new information.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Our approach will continue to be taking conservative measures for ourselves and our communities. We know that in a situation like this, it is not possible to wait until all the data is in. We need to make decisions in the dark before it becomes too late. We have tried to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. We would rather be wrong on being too safe than regretting any action that could have had critical impact on our people.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Our response will continue to evolve but today we are announcing some actions that are meant to protect us and help us get through this situation together. Please read the below carefully, there is a lot of important information that you need to be clear on.</p>

    subTitle: `Seven things I learned while working at a creative agency.`,
    excerpt: `Friday was my last day at Ueno, and today is my first day at my new job. It’s a bittersweet feeling. `,
    content: `<p>
              Friday was my last day at Ueno, and today is my first day at my new job. It’s a bittersweet feeling. Ueno is a great company and I’ll miss my lovely colleagues (who, by the way, are not paying me to say that). When this post will be published, I’ll probably be introducing myself to my new ones.
              <br><br>

              I joined Ueno two and a half years ago, as the company’s first Director of Marketing. Agency life was a new experience for me, but I did know the company a little, having been Ueno’s client at my previous job at Reuters. So I guess you could say I’ve been on both sides of the table.
              <br><br>
              
              During my time at Ueno, the agency more than doubled in size, and worked on more varied projects with more varied clients than ever. So before I forget, and for anyone who might be in the same shoes I was in once, I thought I’d jot down a few things I learned along the way.
              <br><br>

              <h3>#1 The customer isn’t always right</h3>
              An agency’s job is not to agree with the client and do what they say, but to open minds and push boundaries. A lot of the value from working with a good agency comes from the different perspectives and ideas that they bring. Your clients will trust and rely on you more if they know you will give an honest, thoughtful response. That’s why they pay you the big bucks! The reason many clients like working with Ueno is that every team member has the confidence to speak up when they think the client is wrong.
              <br><br>

              <h3>#2 Trust is everything</h3>
              No project will ever go perfectly. As Ueno’s CEO often says, “no one comes to us hoping their project will be a disaster.” We all want to make great things. But to do great work you need trust. Without it, you’ve got problems coming. If an agency and a client aren’t on the same team, the project has failed before anyone has moved a pixel. And how do you build trust? By having a real, human connection. (Yes, clients are people too!)
              <br><br>

              <h3>#3 Life is tough, but so are you</h3>
              For a lot of agencies, work comes in big chunks, and the schedule can be unpredictable. Plans constantly change, directions shift, and things fly in from out of left field. Clients want lower costs and higher quality. It’s exhilarating and exhausting, and it’s not for everyone. Processes can be difficult to establish because every client and project is different, so sometimes it feels like you’re constantly reinventing the wheel. The most successful people at agencies are those who can adapt quickly, keep an open mind, and find new solutions.
              <br><br>

              <h3>#4 There’s no such thing as ‘a creative’</h3>
              I have come to hate it when people use ‘creative’ as a noun. It implies that creativity is a gift that only some chosen people have, which is wrong. (Some of the most brilliant creative problem solving I’ve seen involves the production team playing schedule-tetris on the fly to pull together a project team on a moment’s notice, and the People Experience team wrangling 65 employees for a week-long company retreat.) The right to be creative isn’t reserved to the design team. If you acknowledge that a great idea can come from anyone, then great ideas will start coming from everyone.
              <br><br>

              <h3>#5 Culture is the big differentiator</h3>
              What makes one agency better than the next is not just the individuals who work there, but the overall culture. You can have the most talented individuals, but unless they respect and support each other you won’t get far. Culture is also how you treat people. If an agency’s MO is to work people into the ground, the revolving door will keep flying, and there will be no space or trust for creative ideas to flourish. (When people at Ueno go on vacation they really go on vacation.)
              <br><br>

              <h3>#6 Clients want to be good — sometimes agencies just have to show them how</h3>
              Why are some clients more fun, productive, and easy to work with? Maybe they’re born like that. Or maybe their agency took the time to teach them what to expect from their partnership, explaining things like how the creative process works, and how to give constructive feedback. Not all clients know how to be good clients. Sometimes you have to help them.
              <br><br>

              <h3>#7 Agencies also want to be good — sometimes clients just have to show them how</h3>
              Why do some agencies bring more value to the projects they work on? Maybe they were always like that. Or maybe it’s because their clients treat them as equals (not as a mere vendor or a “resource”), take time to get to know them on a personal level, and share as much information as possible about where they’re coming from and the problems they’re trying to solve. Communication is key. The more information you give an agency, the better they will be able to help you, and the more they’ll want to.
              <br><br>

              Having said all this, my biggest takeaway is that your job is what you make it and who you surround yourself with. Ueno is a special place because the people are so talented, welcoming, and different from each other. The culture that grew from these people makes Ueno unlike any other agency I’ve seen or heard about, in a good way. I’m so grateful to have had this opportunity and made some really good friends in the process. No bullshit!

            Say hello to Meghan Rose, pictured here above, enjoying her daily recommended dose of vitamin C.
            <br><br>

            Meghan has just joined Ueno as a designer at our San Francisco office. We are especially grateful to her for having moved all the way from Toronto to be with us, which is exactly as nice of her as national stereotype enthusiasts would expect.
            <br><br>

            "I have always been a fan of Ueno," she said in a quote that sounds like we made it up, but is nonetheless real. "I wasn’t really searching for new opportunities and didn’t expect to be moving to SF. But I’m always up for an adventure and I love change.”
            <br><br>

            Meghan does a little bit of everything. After studying Interaction Design at Sheridan College, she worked with agencies in Toronto and Amsterdam, “doing lots of Augmented Reality projects, brand activation campaigns, and installations.”</p>`,
